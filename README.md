# What is this?

cakery helps you with file path issues; never worry again about relative paths with cakery's helper methods.
Purpose built for our continuous integration & deployment infrastructure at FittrÂ®.

## File, pwd, and project relative
There are 3 relative ways of looking at a path in *cakery*.
  * File Relative - A path relative to the current code file
  * pwd Relative - A path relative to the current `pwd` pointer
  * project Relative - A path relative to a project root (think rails)

## Usage
cakery's path helpers work by re-opening the string class to include a set of helper methods. Various
other methods are put into the global object space.

## String Extension Methods
  * `fr` (File relative) - Returns an absolute path from the relative string given assuming the current file is the origin.
  * `pr(file)` (Project relative) - Returns an absolute path from the relative string given assuming the first ancestor folder containing `file` is the origin

## 

### Examples
```ruby
#Open a file in the same directory as the first anscestor containing a .git file

```
